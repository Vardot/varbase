Feature: Content Editing - Rich Text Editor - Convert URLs into links
As a logged in user with a permission to use the rich text editor
I want to add raw URLs and links in the rich text editor
So that they will be converted to links and visitors can click on them.

  @javascript  @local @development @staging @production
  Scenario: Check if inserted raw URL will convert into a link using the "Rich editor" text format when we save a new Basic page
    Given I am a logged in user with the "Site admin" user
     When I go to "/node/add/page"
      And wait
     Then I should see "Create Basic page"
     When I select "full_html" from "body[0][format]"
      And I fill in "Test convert URLs" for "Title"
      And I fill in the rich text editor field "Body" with "<p>Test line #1 <br /> Test line #2 http://drupal.org <br /> Test line #3</p>"
     Then I press "Save"
      And wait
      And I should see "Test line #1"
      And I should see "Test line #2 http://drupal.org"
      And I should see "Test line #3"
