Feature: Module Requirements - Standard Entity Queue Management - Have the option to Reverse order in admin view.
As a logged in user with a permisstioto manage entityqueues 
I well be able to view the order of entities in entity queues in a reverse order.
So that they will have a flipped order at the front-end.
